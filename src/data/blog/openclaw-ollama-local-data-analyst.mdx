# Build a Local Data Analyst: OpenClaw + Ollama (CSV Insights, No Cloud)

In this post you will learn how to turn OpenClaw and Ollama into a local data analyst. OpenClaw is an open-source AI agent that can run tools and workflows on your machine. [Ollama](https://ollama.com) runs large language models (LLMs) locally. Together they can read your CSV and PDF files, create charts, and write reports without sending any data to the cloud. This is ideal if you care about privacy or work with sensitive data. We use simple English and give you the full setup and an example workflow so you can build your own OpenClaw data analyst in a few steps. For the basics, see [OpenClaw setup on normal laptops](/blog/openclaw-setup-guide-normal-laptops).

## What You Build

You will have a system where:

- You upload a CSV or add a PDF for context.
- OpenClaw runs the workflow and calls tools (e.g. Python scripts).
- Ollama provides the LLM for reasoning and summaries.
- You get charts (PNG), reports (Markdown), and traces (JSON) all on your laptop or server.

No data leaves your machine. This is a fully local OpenClaw and Ollama setup.

## Core Stack in Simple Terms

| Part | Role |
|------|------|
| OpenClaw | Runs the workflow, calls tools, and talks to the LLM. It is the boss. |
| Ollama | Runs the LLM (e.g. llama3:8b) on your machine. No cloud. |
| Your scripts | Do the real work: read CSV, draw charts, save reports. |
| Outputs | PNG charts, Markdown reports, and JSON tool traces. You can view them in the OpenClaw UI. |

## Full Setup in 4 Steps

### Step 1: Run OpenClaw and Ollama

You need both running at the same time.

- Start the OpenClaw gateway: run `openclaw gateway` in one terminal.
- Start Ollama and pull a model: run `ollama run llama3` in another terminal (or use another model like llama3.2).

Leave both running.

### Step 2: Point OpenClaw to Ollama

Edit your OpenClaw config at `~/.openclaw/config.yaml` and set the LLM to Ollama:

```yaml
llm: ollama:llama3
```

Use the same model name you use with `ollama run`. Save the file and restart the OpenClaw gateway if it was already running.

### Step 3: Web UI and Uploads

You need a small script (e.g. `web_assistant.py`) that handles file uploads from the OpenClaw web UI and triggers the local data analyst workflow. That script calls the OpenClaw flow (e.g. `/local-data-analyst`) when you upload a CSV or add a PDF. The exact code depends on how you build your UI; the idea is: upload, run OpenClaw workflow, get results.

### Step 4: Analysis Engine (Python Tool)

Your analysis engine (e.g. `main.py`) uses [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) to read the CSV and Matplotlib to draw charts. You expose it as an OpenClaw tool. OpenClaw will call it when the workflow needs to analyze data. Example of what runs:

- Tool call: `python main.py --csv data.csv --out trend.png`
- Then the LLM (via Ollama) reads the chart and your context and writes a summary into `report.md`.

So the flow is: CSV in, tool runs, chart and report out. All local.

## Example Workflow

**Input:** A sales CSV file and maybe a PDF with extra context.

**What happens:** OpenClaw runs your Python tool with the CSV. The tool produces something like `trend_chart.png`. Ollama then helps summarize the trends and the result is saved in `analysis_report.md`. You also get a `tool_trace.json` so you can see what ran. You can preview the chart and report in the OpenClaw web UI.

**Outputs:**

- `trend_chart.png`, chart image
- `analysis_report.md`, written summary
- `tool_trace.json`, trace of tool calls

## Tuning Your OpenClaw Data Analyst

You can use different Ollama models for different steps. For example use a fast model for tool calls and a smarter model for the final summary. Change the model in the config or in the workflow and restart. This way you get a good balance between speed and quality for your local OpenClaw data analyst. For persistent context across sessions, pair this with [OpenClaw memory fix (Cognee or Mem0)](/blog/openclaw-memory-fix-cognee-mem0).

You now have a simple, privacy-first OpenClaw and Ollama data analyst that works offline and keeps your data on your machine.
