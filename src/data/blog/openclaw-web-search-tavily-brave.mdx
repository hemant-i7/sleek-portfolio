# OpenClaw Search Showdown: Tavily vs Brave vs Built-In (Free Configs + Plugins)

In this post we compare the main ways to do web search in OpenClaw. OpenClaw is an open-source AI agent that can search the web to answer questions and do research. By default it has a built-in web search, but many users also use Brave or Tavily for better results. The Brave API free tier has changed, so more people are switching to [Tavily](https://app.tavily.com) for OpenClaw. Here we explain the pros and cons of each option in simple English and give you ready-to-use OpenClaw configs and plugin steps. You will see how to set up Tavily, how to use multiple search engines together, and how to test your OpenClaw search. For install basics, see [OpenClaw setup guide](/blog/openclaw-setup-guide-normal-laptops).

## OpenClaw Search Options: Quick Comparison

Below is a simple table that sums up the three main ways you can do web search in OpenClaw. Use it to pick the best option for your use case.

| Engine | Pros | Cons | Cost / Free tier | Best for |
|--------|------|------|------------------|----------|
| Built-in WebSearch | No setup, works out of the box | Noisy results, few filters | Free | Quick tests and simple queries |
| Brave API | Good for privacy, RAG-friendly | Free tier discontinued, now paid | Paid | Old setups that already use Brave |
| Tavily MCP | Clean AI-oriented results, extract and crawl tools | You need an API key | 1000 free requests per month | Agents, research, and serious search |

So for most new OpenClaw users we recommend Tavily: you get a free tier and better AI search. Below we show how to install and configure the Tavily plugin for OpenClaw.

## How to Set Up Tavily Search in OpenClaw

Tavily gives you tools like `tavily_search` and `tavily_extract` so your OpenClaw agent can search the web and pull clean content from URLs. Follow these steps.

### Step 1: Install the Tavily Plugin

In your terminal run:

```bash
openclaw plugins install openclaw-tavily
```

Get an API key from [app.tavily.com](https://app.tavily.com) if you do not have one. The free tier is enough to start.

### Step 2: Set Your API Key

Export the key so OpenClaw can use it:

```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Replace `sk-...` with your real key. You can add this line to your shell profile so it is set every time you open a terminal.

### Step 3: Use the Tools

Once the plugin is installed and the key is set, OpenClaw will use Tavily automatically when the workflow needs web search. The main tools are:

- **tavily_search**, search the web with options for domains and time range.
- **tavily_extract**, get clean Markdown from a URL.

You do not need to wire them manually; the agent will call them when needed. Your OpenClaw search is now powered by Tavily.

## Use More Than One Search Engine (Multi-Engine Config)

You can set Tavily as the default and add fallbacks so OpenClaw tries other engines if needed. Edit your OpenClaw config and add something like:

```yaml
search:
  default: tavily
  fallback: [brave, duckduckgo]
```

Restart the OpenClaw gateway after saving. Then test with a slash command like `/research latest OpenClaw news`. The agent will use Tavily first and fall back to the others if needed. This gives you a solid OpenClaw search setup. For persistent context across chats, pair with [OpenClaw memory fix (Cognee or Mem0)](/blog/openclaw-memory-fix-cognee-mem0).

You now have a clear comparison of OpenClaw search options and a working Tavily-based setup with optional fallbacks.
