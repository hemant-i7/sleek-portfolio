# Ditch OpenClaw Crashes: Top 5 Alternatives + ZeroClaw Migration in 2 Commands

In this post we look at what to do when OpenClaw is too unstable on your machine. OpenClaw is a popular open-source AI agent for automation, but some users face constant crashes or high RAM use. Here we list five solid OpenClaw alternatives and show how to migrate to ZeroClaw in just a few commands. We use simple English and give you a clear table of options plus step-by-step migration so you can switch without losing your memory or tools. This guide helps you choose an alternative and move from OpenClaw to a lighter setup. Try the [OpenClaw setup guide](/blog/openclaw-setup-guide-normal-laptops) first if you have not tuned your install yet.

## When to Think About Leaving OpenClaw

OpenClaw is great for many users. But if you see a lot of crashes (for example more than 20% of the time) or your PC runs out of RAM every time you run it, you might want to try an alternative. Before you switch, it is worth trying the [OpenClaw setup guide](/blog/openclaw-setup-guide-normal-laptops) and the [OpenClaw memory fix with Cognee or Mem0](/blog/openclaw-memory-fix-cognee-mem0). If you have done that and it is still unstable, the options below are good next steps.

## Top 5 OpenClaw Alternatives: Quick Comparison

The table below sums up five OpenClaw alternatives. Each has different strengths: some use less RAM, some are easier to migrate to, and some are better for VPS or enterprise.

| Alternative | Why switch | RAM / setup | Migration ease |
|-------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| ZeroClaw | SQLite memory, many LLMs, sandbox | 2GB RAM, install via Cargo | Run `zeroclaw migrate openclaw` and you are done |
| NanoClaw | Very light, no Node | 1GB RAM, single binary | Copy your config over |
| TrustClaw | Focus on security and enterprise | 4GB RAM, Docker | Export plugins and reconfigure |
| MemU Bot | Built around memory | 2GB RAM | Import your Markdown memory |
| ClawdBot | Tuned for VPS | VPS recommended | Full backup and restore |

ZeroClaw is the easiest if you want a one-command style migration from OpenClaw. Install [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) first, then follow the next section.

## How to Migrate from OpenClaw to ZeroClaw

ZeroClaw can import your OpenClaw memory and config. So you do not start from zero. Follow these steps.

### Step 1: Install ZeroClaw

You need Rust and Cargo. Then run:

```bash
cargo install zeroclaw
zeroclaw init
```

This installs ZeroClaw and creates a basic config.

### Step 2: Preview What Will Be Migrated

Before you change anything, do a dry run so you can see what OpenClaw data ZeroClaw will import:

```bash
zeroclaw migrate openclaw --dry-run
```

Check the output. It will list memory and config that will be moved. If that looks good, go to the next step.

### Step 3: Run the Migration

When you are ready, run:

```bash
zeroclaw migrate openclaw
```

ZeroClaw will import your OpenClaw memory and config. After that you can use ZeroClaw with Telegram, Slack, or its own UI. Your OpenClaw setup is now migrated to ZeroClaw in two commands (dry-run then migrate).

## When to Switch to an OpenClaw Alternative

Switch to an alternative when:

- Your OpenClaw crash rate is high (e.g. more than 20% of runs).
- Your machine runs out of RAM or swap every time you use OpenClaw.
- You have already tried the setup and memory fixes and things are still bad.

For low-RAM or budget VPS users, ZeroClaw and NanoClaw are often the best OpenClaw alternatives. For enterprise or strict security, look at TrustClaw. For memory-heavy workflows, MemU Bot is a good option. You now have a clear list of OpenClaw alternatives and a simple way to migrate to ZeroClaw without losing your memory or tools.
