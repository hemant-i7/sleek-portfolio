# Mumbai Dev's OpenClaw 2026 VPS Setup + n8n SEO Automation (Code + Screenshots)

Tired of hour-long videos and shallow “what is OpenClaw” posts? You want a single guide that gets OpenClaw running on a real server, hooked to n8n, with code and India-specific costs. This is that guide.

If you are a developer in Mumbai, Bangalore, or anywhere in India looking for a complete **OpenClaw AI tutorial 2026** that goes beyond YouTube and freeCodeCamp, with real VPS deployment, n8n integration, and costs in rupees, read on. You get a production-ready walkthrough: OpenClaw on a VPS, wired to n8n for SEO automation, with code you can copy and a clear cost breakdown.

## The One Setup That Stays Online (VPS + n8n)

OpenClaw is the open-source AI agent (ex-ClawdBot) that broke GitHub records and was acquired by OpenAI in early 2026. It gives you persistent memory, 24/7 autonomous runs, and real task execution—not just chat. Running it on a **VPS** (Virtual Private Server) means it stays online when your laptop is off. Pairing it with **n8n** adds workflow automation, 400+ integrations, and a security layer: API keys stay in n8n webhooks, not inside the agent. For SEO, that means auto keyword research, content pipelines, and reporting without exposing keys to the agent. In India, a basic droplet on DigitalOcean costs roughly **₹500–1,000/month** ($6–12 USD), which is affordable for solopreneurs and indie devs.

## Your Checklist Before You Start

- A **VPS** with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (DigitalOcean, Vultr, or Hetzner all work; we use DigitalOcean for the ₹ pricing).
- **Minimum:** 1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM, 20 GB SSD. **Recommended for OpenClaw + n8n:** 2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, 50 GB SSD (~₹1,000–1,500/month at ~₹83/USD).
- SSH access and a domain or server IP for webhooks (optional for n8n but needed for production Telegram).
- Basic comfort with terminal, Docker, and environment variables.

## Step 1: Spin Up a VPS and SSH In (India-Friendly)

Sign up at [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) or an Indian reseller. Create a Droplet: choose Ubuntu 22.04, pick the **2 GB RAM / 1 vCPU** plan (~$12/month ≈ ₹996–1,020). You can select a Bangalore or Singapore region for lower latency from India. Add your SSH key during creation, then:

```bash
ssh root@your-server-ip
```

Update the system and install Docker:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y curl git
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Log out and back in so the `docker` group applies, or run the next commands with `sudo docker`.

## Step 2: Run OpenClaw in Docker on the VPS

Two common approaches: **Docker** (recommended for isolation and restart policies) or **Node.js global install**. We use Docker so OpenClaw and n8n can run side by side.

### Option A: Docker Compose (Recommended)

Create a directory and a `docker-compose.yml` for OpenClaw:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/openclaw-n8n && cd ~/openclaw-n8n
```

Create `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  openclaw:
    image: openclaw/openclaw:latest
    container_name: openclaw
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - OPENCLAW_API_KEY=${OPENCLAW_API_KEY}
    volumes:
      - openclaw-data:/app/data
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 1G
          cpus: '1'

volumes:
  openclaw-data:
```

Create a `.env` file (never commit this):

```bash
OPENCLAW_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Then start OpenClaw:

```bash
docker compose up -d openclaw
```

Check logs: `docker compose logs -f openclaw`. The web UI will be at `http://your-server-ip:3000`. For production, put Nginx in front and use HTTPS.

### Option B: Node.js Install (Alternative)

If you prefer the classic install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
npm install -g @openclaw/cli
openclaw init
openclaw gateway start
```

Use a process manager like `pm2` so the gateway restarts on reboot: `pm2 start openclaw -- gateway start`.

## Step 3: Add n8n and the Pre-Built OpenClaw n8n Stack

n8n gives you visual workflows, webhooks, and 400+ nodes (Google Sheets, Slack, Telegram, etc.). A pre-built stack that runs both OpenClaw and n8n is **caprihan/openclaw-n8n-stack** on GitHub. Clone and use it:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/caprihan/openclaw-n8n-stack.git
cd openclaw-n8n-stack
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`: set your OpenClaw API key, n8n encryption key, and any other secrets. Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You now have OpenClaw and n8n on the same host. n8n is typically on port 5678; open `http://your-server-ip:5678` to design workflows. Benefits for SEO:

- **Security:** Send API keys (e.g. SerpAPI, OpenAI) through n8n webhooks so the agent never sees them.
- **Cost:** Route routine tasks (e.g. “fetch top 10 results for keyword X”) through n8n; reports say 60–80% token savings vs. full agent autonomy.
- **Auditability:** Every workflow run is logged in n8n.

## Step 4: Your First SEO Workflow (Keyword to Sheet or Telegram)

Example: trigger OpenClaw from n8n when a keyword is added to a Google Sheet.

1. In n8n, create a workflow: trigger **Schedule** or **Google Sheets – new row**.
2. Add an **HTTP Request** node: POST to your OpenClaw webhook URL with the keyword in the body.
3. OpenClaw (with the right skills) runs keyword research or content brief and returns a result.
4. Add a node to write the result back to the sheet or send it to Telegram.

Your OpenClaw instance must have the webhook or API endpoint enabled and a skill that accepts “keyword” and returns structured data. The exact URL and payload depend on your OpenClaw version and how you expose it (e.g. via Nginx and a path like `/webhook/seo`).

## What This Costs in India (2026)

| Item | USD/mo | INR/mo (≈₹83/USD) |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| DigitalOcean 1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM | ~$12 | ~₹996–1,020 |
| Domain (optional) | ~$1–2 | ~₹83–166 |
| OpenClaw (self-hosted) | $0 | ₹0 |
| n8n (self-hosted) | $0 | ₹0 |
| **Total (typical)** | **~$12** | **~₹1,000** |

This is for a small but production-ready OpenClaw + n8n setup. Add API costs (OpenAI, SerpAPI, etc.) depending on usage.

## When Things Break: WebSocket, RAM, Firewall

- **WebSocket errors (1006):** Check that the gateway is running and that `gateway.auth.token` (not `gateway.token`) is set correctly in config. Restart the service.
- **Out of memory:** Increase Droplet RAM or add swap: `sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile && sudo chmod 600 /swapfile && sudo mkswap /swapfile && sudo swapon /swapfile`.
- **Port 3000/5678 not reachable:** Open firewall: `sudo ufw allow 22 && sudo ufw allow 3000 && sudo ufw allow 5678 && sudo ufw enable`.

## Go Further: Screenshots and the n8n-Workflow Skill

For screenshots of the n8n workflow and OpenClaw UI, see the companion post or the GitHub repo’s README. To go deeper, add the **n8n-workflow-automation** skill so OpenClaw can design and output n8n workflows from natural language. That’s where you get “auto keyword research” and “AdSense-ready content pipelines” without writing every workflow by hand.

## Lock It Down: Reverse Proxy, SSH, Firewall

Running OpenClaw on a VPS means it is exposed to the internet if you open ports. Best practices:

- **Never commit `.env`:** Use environment variables for API keys; add `.env` to `.gitignore`.
- **Use a reverse proxy:** Put Nginx or Caddy in front of OpenClaw and n8n. Terminate SSL (e.g. Let's Encrypt) and expose only ports 80/443.
- **Restrict SSH:** Disable password login, use SSH keys only, and consider changing the default SSH port.
- **Firewall:** Only allow 22 (SSH), 80, 443, and optionally 5678 if n8n is public. Block direct access to 3000 from the internet and proxy through Nginx.

Docker gives you process isolation; for stricter sandboxing, some teams run OpenClaw in a separate network namespace or use Docker's `security_opt` and resource limits.

## Keep an Eye on It: Logs and Alerts

Check OpenClaw and n8n health:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f openclaw
docker compose logs -f n8n
```

For production, add a simple cron job or n8n workflow that pings your OpenClaw endpoint and sends a Telegram alert if it fails. n8n has a built-in Telegram node—use it to get daily digest or failure alerts on your phone.

## What You Should See (Screenshot Checklist)

When you follow this guide, you will see:

1. **Droplet creation:** Region selection (e.g. Bangalore/Singapore), size 2 GB RAM.
2. **SSH session:** `apt update`, Docker install, `docker compose up -d`.
3. **OpenClaw UI:** Browser at `http://your-ip:3000` with the agent chat.
4. **n8n UI:** Workflow editor at `http://your-ip:5678` with a sample trigger and HTTP node to OpenClaw.
5. **Cost:** DigitalOcean billing page or your reseller invoice in INR.

Keeping these screenshots in your own doc or blog helps you reproduce the setup and troubleshoot later.

## India Tips: Latency, Payments, Compliance

- **Latency:** If your audience or tools are in India, choose a Singapore or Mumbai (when available) data center. Ping from your machine: `ping sg1.your-provider.com`.
- **Payments:** DigitalOcean charges in USD. Use a card that does not add forex markup, or use an Indian reseller (e.g. Indian Server Hosting) that may offer INR pricing. Keep a buffer for exchange rate changes.
- **Compliance:** If you handle user data, ensure your VPS provider's terms and region align with your compliance needs (e.g. data localization).

## Summary

This OpenClaw AI tutorial 2026 gives you a full VPS setup with n8n and India-friendly costs.
